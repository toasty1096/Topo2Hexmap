# Topo2Hexmap, map maker tool for megamek

Legal disclaimer: I am NOT affiliated with megamek or it's creators, this is a fan made program to make map creation easier.

This is a small application designed to take input images, convert them into bitmaps of your desired size, then use those values to generate a .board file compatible with megamek and it's map editor.

Currently its just a small program I just threw together for personal use, its a little rough around the edges looks wise and I may polish it up a bit but I most likely wont be giving any major updates with new features or anything.

The actual app is in "Topo2Hexmap-1.0.zip", if you run into any issues with it working, please let me know, this is my first github repository and I could have easily messed something up
