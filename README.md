# Topo2Hexmap â€“ Map Creation Tool for MegaMek

*Disclaimer: This project is not affiliated with MegaMek or its creators, It is a fan-made utility made to simplify map creation.*

## Overview

Topo2Hexmap is a small program that converts input images into bitmaps generates a .board file compatible with MegaMek and its map editor.

This tool was initially intended for my personal use and is still pretty rough around the edges. While minor graphical improvements may be added over time, major feature updates are not currently planned.

## Getting Started

The application can be found in the file:
Topo2Hexmap-1.0.zip

Simply download and extract the archive to begin using the tool.

If you encounter any issues while running the program, please open an issue in this repository. As this is my first GitHub project, feedback and bug reports are especially welcome.
